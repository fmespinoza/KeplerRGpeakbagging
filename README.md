# Massive peak bagging of red giants in the Kepler field

A library of frequencies, amplitdes, and lifetimes of more than 250,000 individual l=0 to 3 oscillations modes of 6179 red giants from APOKASC sample. The parameters were extracted with the Automated Bayesian peak-Bagging Algorithm (ABBA).

Visulaisations (two pdf files per star) of the results are located in the directories *EchellePlots* and *SpectrumPlots*

To download the full repository (~650MB) type the following command 
```
git clone https://github.com/tkallinger/KeplerRGpeakbagging.git
```
Individual mode files can be downloaded using the Python function *read_modefile.py*
